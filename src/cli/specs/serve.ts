      '--pairing-address changes only the client-advertised address; use a reachable LAN, Tailscale, SSH-forward, or reverse-proxy endpoint.',
      '--bind controls the interface the runtime listens on; it accepts a literal IP such as 127.0.0.1, a Tailscale address, or 0.0.0.0. --mobile-pairing needs no --bind or --bind 0.0.0.0.',
      'Serve accepts clients from localhost, LAN (10/8, 172.16/12, 192.168/16, link-local, fc00::/7) and Tailscale (100.64/10, fd7a:115c:a1e0::/48) addresses. Public addresses are also accepted with --allow-public, when --pairing-address is a hostname or public IP, once a paired device has connected from one, or while devices paired before this check existed remain paired. Addresses inside a network prefix of one of this host interfaces (for example same-network global IPv6) count as LAN. --refuse-public refuses public addresses in every case and cannot be combined with --allow-public. The startup log states which applies.',
      'Use --recipe-json with --project-root from VM recipes to print the recipe result JSON and leave the server running.',
      'Use --mobile-pairing to print a mobile-scoped pairing QR/link instead of the default runtime-environment pairing link. To pair later without restarting, run `coding pair`.',

      "--reclaim-stale-lock starts nothing. When a start refuses because this profile's lock may belong to a Coding Agent 2 on another machine sharing this home (for example after a reboot, on a network home), it checks that the lock was written on a host with this name in an earlier boot, was last written or refreshed at least 5 minutes ago, and that nothing answers on this machine at its holder's endpoints. Those checks cannot rule out another machine with the same host name, so it then only prints what it found (exit 2); add --yes, once you are sure no other machine sharing this home runs Coding Agent 2 for this profile, to clear it (exit 0). It exits 1 when a check fails and 4 when there is no lock. --data-root names the data root the refusal printed. --json prints the status (none, eligible, refused or reclaimed). Linux only.",
      'On macOS, after Coding Agent 2 serve aborts at startup (it could not register with Launch Services), later runs from the same environment refuse for 30 minutes with exit code 78. Use --force to try anyway.',
      '--supervise is for service managers (launchd, systemd). Coding Agent 2 serve then restarts the server itself with growing delays instead of exiting when it stops, waits while an update replaces the app, and waits while another Coding Agent 2 serves this profile. On the orcad runtime (the default), a supervised server does not start without its terminal daemon, because terminals outside it would not survive a restart; that counts as a failure. After 6 failures in 15 minutes it gives up and exits with code 0 so the manager stops too, and later supervised runs refuse until a new build is installed or --force is passed. Not available on Windows yet.',
      'Experimental and off by default: set CODING_AGENT_TERMINAL_PROCESS_CEILING=<n> (64 or more) before the terminal host starts to have the OS cap how many processes each terminal may run (Linux, through a systemd user scope per terminal, which needs a user manager that outlives logout; Windows, through a job per terminal). `coding serve` reports the ceiling as on or off, with the reason.',

A terminal over its limit has its largest process OOM-killed; the host and other terminals keep running. Sizes take K, M, G or T. A limit the host cannot enforce is skipped and logged in the terminal host log. No effect on macOS or Windows.'
